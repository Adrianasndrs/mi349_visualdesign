        <h1>What I Learned about Visual Design</h1>
        <p>Going through the "10 things we did not cover" list,
            the one that was most interesting to me as a designer was the visual design category.
            I have always been interested in design and how to make different softwares and technologies look
            good. The readings and the video taught me a lot about how important the basics are to good visual design.
            While doing the excercises from the masterclass, it surprised me how difficult the seemingly basic drawings were.
            Visual designers must be precise and thoughful about every design they make, and it is not as easy as the designs make it look!
